# Generator and yield in python

Have you ever had to work with a dataset so large that it overwhelmed your machine’s memory? Or maybe you have a complex function that needs to maintain an internal state every time it’s called, but the function is too small to justify creating its own class. In these cases and more, generators and the Python yield statement are here to help.

* What generators are and how to use them
* How to create generator functions and expressions
* How the Python yield statement works
* How to use multiple Python yield statements in a generator function
* How to use advanced generator methods
* How to build data pipelines with multiple generators

- Analogy:- Climbing stairs.
- Storing sequence in memory like lists, when we are big data computer memory is limited, 
generators allows to break problem in small chunks.
