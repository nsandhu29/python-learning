# Data Structure and Algorithms
## Data Structure:
A program is set of instructions which perform operations on data:

How we organise data, data structure play important role.

A data structure is way of organising and holding data in some manner so later it can be accessed, queried or 
updated easily and quickly.

- Operations on data structure:
    - Insert
    - Delete
    - Sort


- Common data structures:
  - Arrays
  - LinkedLists
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees
  - Heaps
  - Tries
  - Graph
  

## Algorithms
A set of instructions to do a certain task.

- Searching
- Sorting
- Traversal (Tree, Graph)


## Concepts
- Big O Notations
- Memory
- Logarithms
- Recursions
- Space and time complexities

## Search Algorithm:
- Binary Search
  - Input sorted list. Guess middle number and eliminate half.
  - Complexity $log_2 n$
