## Python Notes
#### String
> - Strings are objects we can run methods on strings
> - f string
>
#### Loops in python
> * break
> * continue
> * else

#### Class introspection
> * dir()
> * type()
> * 

#### Data Structures
> * Complexity of each data structure
> * Dictionary
> * List
>   - list are unordered
>   - sorted()
>   
> * Sets is like list that don't allow duplicates.
> * tuples
> * list comprehensions
>   - very common technique
>   ```python 
>   [x for x in range(10)]
>   {x for x in 'superduper' if x not in 'dp'}
>   ```
>   * mixed data structures

#### Functions
> * Scope
> * Decorators
>    - item 1
>    - item 2
> * Generators
>   - Generator functions
> * Return
> * Yield
> * functions are first class objects


#### Class
> * Constructor \__init\__(self)
> * Getter Setter
> * Inheritance
> * Iterators
> * \__str\__
> * Organise and structure code. Maintain and plan is easy
> * Groups together data and behavior into one place
> * Class - Blueprint for object
> * Methods - Functions in class
> * Composition - Building complex objects out of other objects
> * Name mangling
> * Method resolution order
> * \__mro\__
> * Composition
> * Interface
> * Magic Methods - Python automatically associate with class methods
>   - Customize object behavior and integrate with the language
>   - Define how objects are represented as strings
>   - Control access to attribute values, both for get ans set
>   - Build in comparison and equality testing capabilities
>
> * dataclass
> * dataclass decorators and frozen
> * classmethod 
>   - Requires access to the class object to call other class methods or constructors
> * staticmethod 
>   - No access needed to either class or instance object
>   - Most likely an implementation detail of the class
>   - May be able to be moved outside the class to become a global-scope function in the module
> * Object oriented programming resources
